# 🤖 **Roblox AutoPlay & AutoClicker**

Welcome to the official **Roblox AutoPlay and AutoClicker Script Hub**. This repository contains two powerful Lua scripts:

* 🎮 **AutoPlay**: Automates character movement and behaviors.
* 🖱️ **AutoClicker**: Automates mouse clicks.

These scripts are meant for educational or testing use in sandbox environments, primarily for **Roblox shooter games** that support **first-person**. **Third-person** support **might** come soon!
