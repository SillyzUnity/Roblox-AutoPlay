AutoPlay Script for Roblox
--------------------------

This script automates gameplay actions like movement and interaction, letting your character play on its own. Great for grinding or farming while AFK.

Recommended for Best Performance:
Use this together with the "AutoClicker" script for better results.

AutoClicker handles fast clicking and tapping, while AutoPlay takes care of gameplay logic and movement. Running both gives you smoother and faster automation.

Download both scripts from the same repository in the "source" folder or in the description on the front page.
