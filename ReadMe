# 🤖 AutoPlay Script for Roblox

This script automates basic gameplay actions, allowing your character to play on its own. Ideal for grinding, farming, or staying active in-game without manual input.

## 🔧 Recommended for Best Performance

We **highly recommend** using this alongside our [AutoClicker Script](./AutoClicker.lua) for faster and smoother automation.

> 💡 AutoClicker handles rapid interactions (clicking, tapping, etc.), while AutoPlay takes care of movement and decision-making.

Using both scripts together provides the best automation experience in supported Roblox games.
